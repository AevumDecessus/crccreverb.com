<h3>Christina Garcia-Bakker</h3>
<p>Volunteer</p>
<p>Born in Illinois raised in Holland she love to travel. From the people she meets, the creations she sees, and the historical place 
she experiences, she loves connecting it all back to God. She does the same with all her creative endeavors, and while enjoying the 
art and stories from others, she loves to bring it all back to God, how holy and good He is, and how broken we are. She loves the 
Lord and really wants to awaken the Love for Him in the hearts of the students, in the hope they will serve Him with joy, love, and 
thanksgiving</p>

<h3>Austin Shirey</h3>
<p>Volunteer</p>
<p>Austin Shirey is Sarah's husband - a role he firmly believes is the greatest in the world! Austin loves anything that has to do 
with fantasy, superheroes, science fiction, video games, music and movies; he's actually currently writing his own fantasy novels in 
his spare time. When he's not being nerdy, he loves serving alongside his "nerd mate" Sarah and volunteering with the youth group. He 
desires to have the youth experience the gospel freedom Jesus offers and to instill a love of God's Word in their hearts, that they 
might be young men and women who "seek the Lord continually" (Psalm 105:4)</p>
